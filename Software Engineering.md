# Introduction to Software Engineering

**Software Engineering** is the application of engineering approach for software development of systematic applications. It defines the standard process for the design, development,
testing and maintenance of the software. 


## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) 

SDLC defines the life-cycle of the software. Below are the stages in the cycle (may vary).
- Planning
- Requirement Analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance

## Software Development Models

Over the years, multiple models have been used and proposed for the efficient development process. Below are some of the models.
- Waterfall Model
- Incremental Model
- Constructive Cost (COCOMO) Model
- Prototyping Model
- Spiral Model
- WIN-WIN Spiral Model
- V Model
- Agile Model

## Methodologies and Frameworks 

- Rapid Application Development 
- Model-Driven Engineering
- Rational Unified Process
- EXtreme Programming
- Scaled Agile Framework 
- Scrum
- Kanban
